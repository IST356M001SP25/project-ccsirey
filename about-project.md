### What it does
BART is the regional metro system in the bay area. Depending on station location and traffic, transit may be even faster than driving. This streamlit powered applications allows the user to put in two bart stations and get the driving time, as well as the transit time, to compare and pick the best alternative. The program uses two APIs. One to retieve the place ID from thje bart station and another to chart the directions between the two place IDs

### How you run my project

Running the project is very simple. As long as streamlit is installed, you can run the streamlit_ui.py file and will be redirected to a web browser. From there, you would need to put in two stations from the drop down list. From there

### Other things you need to know

A general knowledge of what BART is would be helpful context as well as the population distribution and geography of the bay area although neither of these are required to understand what is happening.
